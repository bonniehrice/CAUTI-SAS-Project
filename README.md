# CAUTI-SAS-Project
# MPH capstone project investigating catheter-associated urinary tract infections and patient perception of care.
#  Is patient perception of timeliness of care (i.e., did they receive help when they asked for it?) associated with increased risk of CAUTIs hospital wide.
# Previous studies have shown that CAUTIs are associated with unnecessary and unnecessarily long urinary catheter use, which leads to the growth of biofilms (Nicolle, 2014)
# Quick response to patients’ needs may reflect more attention being paid to the necessity of a urinary catheter, and thus lower CAUTI rates.
# Inversely, slow response time – as perceived by patients – may be associated with a greater risk of CAUTI.
